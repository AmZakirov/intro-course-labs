> As a scenario, I would like to consider an example of the development of an AAA game that is planned to be released on several gaming platforms.

<em><b>Problem №1: </b></em>

One of the difficulties may be the lack of an automated process for building and deploying the game on different platforms. The build process was manual and required significant time and effort, which slowed down the development and implementation of new features.

<span style="color:red"><b>Possible solutions:</b></span>

- Build and Deployment Automation: The DevOps team suggests using build and deployment automation tools and practices such as CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment). Using CI/CD, the team can automate the process of building and deploying the game on different platforms
- Using containers: The DevOps team suggests using containerization, for example using Docker. This will allow you to package your gaming application and its dependencies into containers that can be easily deployed on different platforms. This approach will ensure consistency and repeatability in the game deployment process.

<em><b>Problem №2: </b></em>

Another problem could be the game's slow response time to player input. In our case, it takes too long, which can negatively affect user experience and satisfaction.

- Performance Monitoring: The DevOps team implements game performance monitoring, collecting data on system response time and performance. This allows you to identify problem areas and optimize your code or infrastructure to improve response times.
- Automatic scaling: The DevOps team configures automatic scaling of the game infrastructure depending on the load. This allows you to dynamically increase resources as needed to ensure fast response and minimize latency.

<em><b>Problem №3: </b></em>

Finally, the development team notices that the game has insufficient security measures, which could lead to vulnerabilities and player data breaches.

<span style="color:red"><b>Possible solutions:</b></span>
- Automated Security Testing: The DevOps team implements automated security testing to identify vulnerabilities and security issues in the game. This allows for early detection and correction of security problems.
- Regular Security Audits: The DevOps team conducts regular game security audits to verify compliance with security standards and identify potential vulnerabilities. This helps ensure that player data is secure and protected.
