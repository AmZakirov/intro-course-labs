## DevOps core principles and practices:
### 1. Collaboration:
The collaborative nature of DevOps involves close communication and collaboration between different teams and roles within software development and operations. This principle encourages teams to work together, share knowledge and experience, and solve problems together. </br>

<b>For example</b>, the development team and the testing team collaborate to create automated tests that quickly check the functionality and quality of the code. Developers can give testers access to the development environment and help set up test cases, and testers in turn provide feedback and help identify problems and improve the quality of the product. </br>

### 2. Data-Based Decision Making:
The next core principle is to base your decisions on data. This principle helps teams make decisions based on facts and measurable results, rather than just intuition or guesswork.

By analyzing data and metrics, we can determine how successfully the problem was resolved and what changes to the system or processes led to positive results. This helps teams learn from experience and make better decisions in the future, which in turn can reduce the time it takes to resolve similar problems.

Thus, pre-collection of data helps reduce the time required to resolve problems through rapid discovery, root cause analysis, and evaluation of the effectiveness of solutions based on data and metrics.
</br>

### 3. Customer-Centric Decision Making:
The customer plays a major role in the DevOps lifecycle. Therefore, the principle in question focuses on creating products and services that best meet customer expectations and requirements. Also, this principle in DevOps implies the use of data about customers and their needs to make informed decisions in the process of developing and operating software.

<b>Examples</b>: </br>
- Firstly, the DevOps team analyzes customer experience-related metrics such as page load time, bounce rates, conversion rates, and others. These metrics help you understand what aspects of a product or service can be improved to improve customer satisfaction. </br>
- Secondly, the DevOps team includes customers in the development process, for example through participation in user testing or feedback in the early stages of development. This allows the team to get direct feedback from customers and take their needs and preferences into account when making decisions about further development. </br>

### 4. Constant Improvement:
The core idea of this principle is that the team continually strives to improve its processes and practices to achieve high productivity, quality and efficiency. This principle implies constant analysis, evaluation and adjustment of the teamâ€™s current working methods in search of optimal solutions. </br>

<b>Examples:</b></br>
- Regular Retrospectives: The team holds periodic meetings after the release of a specific feature or project to discuss the past period and identify improvements that can be made in the next iteration or project. Retrospectives can involve discussing problems, why they occurred, and jointly proposing solutions. </br>
- Agile technology applications such as Scrum or Kanban actively integrate the principle into their practices. Regular reviews and analysis of working systems help the team identify problems and improve development processes. </br>

### 5. Responsibility Throughout the Lifecycle:
This principle is one of the key ones in DevOps. It implies that responsibility for developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining an application or service should be shared among all team members. Each member of the DevOps team takes responsibility for the entire chain of processes from idea creation to operation of the finished product. </br>

<b>Examples: </b></br>
- Inclusion of developers in the testing and quality control process. Developers are required to write unit tests for their code and participate in general demonstrations of product functionality.</br>
- Automation of building, testing and deployment of applications. Each step should be automated and integrated into the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) cycle. </br>

### 6. Automation:
This principle is based on the idea that many of the routine and repetitive tasks performed during application development, testing, deployment, and management can be effectively automated. Automation allows you to simplify processes, speed up product development and delivery, improve product quality and reduce the likelihood of errors. </br>

<b>Examples: </b></br>
- Continuous Integration (CI) - the process of automatic assembly and integration of changes from different source codes into one working application. The CI system automatically downloads the latest changes from the code repository, collects, tests and integrates them into a single application.

- Continuous Deployment (CD) - the process of automatically delivering applications to development, testing and production environments. Once the CI process is successfully completed, CD tools automatically deploy the application to the target servers without the need for manual intervention.

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - an approach to automating infrastructure configuration. Instead of manually managing servers and networking, engineers consciously define all infrastructure resources and settings in code that can be automatically deployed and managed. </br>

### 7. Failure as a Learning Opportunity:
This principle is based on the belief that errors are an inevitable part of any software development or system operation. Using failure to learn and improve allows you to identify weaknesses in processes, implement reforms, and take steps to prevent similar mistakes in the future. When an error occurs, it is not viewed as a negative outcome or a point of blame, but as an opportunity to examine the problem and find ways to fix it. </br>

<b>Examples: </b></br>
- Post-mortem analysis: After a major system failure or failure occurs, the DevOps team conducts an analysis and discussion to determine the causes of the failure and develop an action plan to prevent similar errors in the future. This allows the team to learn from mistakes and apply them to improve the quality and reliability of the system.
- Bug Sharing: In DevOps teams, there is a practice of sharing information about failures, errors and problems between teams. This allows team members to learn from the mistakes of others and prevent them from happening again.
