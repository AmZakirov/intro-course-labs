### Task 1: Artifact Registries Research:
#### AWS Artifact Registries  
  
- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR):  
  - Fully managed container registry for storing, managing, and deploying Docker container images.  
  - Integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, and AWS Fargate.  
  
- AWS CodeArtifact:  
  - Fully managed artifact repository that supports software packages.  
  - Provides a secure and scalable way to store, publish, and share packages across organizations and development teams.  
  - Integrates with popular package managers like npm, Maven, and PyPI.  
  
#### GCP Artifact Registries  
  
- Google Container Registry (GCR):  
  - Private container registry for storing, managing, and deploying Docker container images.  
  - Seamlessly integrates with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and other Google Cloud services.  
  
- Google Cloud Storage:  
  - General-purpose object storage service that can be used as an artifact repository.  
  - Provides durability, scalability, and accessibility for storing various types of artifacts.  
  
#### Azure Artifact Registries  
  
- Azure Container Registry (ACR):  
  - Private container registry for storing, managing, and deploying Docker container images.  
  - Seamlessly integrates with Azure services like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Functions.  
  
- Azure Artifacts:  
  - Universal package management system that supports multiple package formats.  
  - Enables teams to create, host, and share packages across different programming languages and platforms.  

### Task 2: Serverless Computing Platform Research

#### AWS Lambda:  
- Key Features:  
    - Fully managed service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.  
    - Supports multiple programming languages such as Node.js, Python, Java, C#, and more.  
    - Allows you to build serverless applications using event-driven architecture.  
    - Automatically scales your applications in response to incoming requests.  
    - Pay only for the compute time consumed.  
    - Integrates with other AWS services like Amazon S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, etc.  
  
#### Google Cloud Functions:  
- Key Features:  
    - Event-driven serverless compute platform for building and connecting cloud services.  
    - Supports multiple programming languages including Node.js, Python, Go, and more.  
    - Automatically scales your applications based on incoming events.  
    - Pay only for the actual execution time of your functions.  
    - Integrates with other Google Cloud services like Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, Firestore, etc.  
    - Provides a command-line interface and a web-based console for managing functions.  
  
#### Azure Functions:  
- Key Features:  
    - Event-driven serverless compute platform that can execute code in response to various triggers.  
    - Supports multiple programming languages such as C#, JavaScript, PowerShell, Python, etc.  
    - Automatically scales your applications based on the number of incoming events.  
    - Pay only for the actual execution time and resources used by your functions.  
    - Integrates with other Azure services like Azure Storage, Event Grid, Cosmos DB, etc.  
    - Provides a web-based portal and a command-line interface for managing functions.
