### <b>Observations or insights: </b>
Overall, creating an IPFS site on Fleek is a fairly simple and convenient way to store files provided by IPFS. There are also quite a few videos on YouTube on using this service. For example, for one video I tried to make a custom domain, but it didnâ€™t work :( [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KqIw2T4qUU)
