### <b>GitHub</b>

<em><b>Description:</b></em></br>
GitHub is a web-based hosting and source code management platform that is widely used in DevOps. It provides capabilities for storing, collaborating and versioning code, as well as integration with other software development tools.

<em><b>Purpose and benefits of the tool in the DevOps context:</b></em></br>
* Wide Community: GitHub is one of the most popular software development platforms, so it has a large community of developers. This means you can easily find open source codes, libraries and frameworks, and get help and support from other developers.
* Ease of Use: GitHub has a simple and intuitive interface that makes it accessible even for beginners. You can easily create repositories, add files, make changes, and manage code versions.
* Integration with other tools: GitHub integrates with many other software development tools, such as CI/CD systems (e.g. Jenkins, Travis CI), issue management systems (e.g. Jira, Trello) and others. This allows you to create chains of automated processes and simplifies work with various tools.
* Collaboration: GitHub provides opportunities to collaborate on code. You can easily invite other developers to collaborate, make comments, and discuss code changes. This promotes effective teamwork and improved code quality.

<em><b>Key features and functionalities:</b></em></br>
* Source code hosting: GitHub allows you to create and store Git repositories for source code management. You can upload your projects, make changes, create branches and merge them.
* Pull requests: GitHub provides pull requests functionality that allows other developers to review your code, make comments, and suggest changes before merging it into the main branch. This facilitates code reviews and improves code quality.
* CI/CD Integration: GitHub integrates with popular continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) systems. You can configure your application to automatically build, test, and deploy whenever there is a change to the repository.

<em><b>Cases and examples of how the tool is used in real-world scenarios:</b></em></br>
* The development team uses GitHub to collaborate on projects. They create repositories, make changes, discuss code, and conduct code reviews using pull requests. This allows them to work effectively as a team and maintain high code quality.
* The DevOps team uses GitHub to manage projects and tasks. They create tasks, set priorities, assign responsibility, and track work progress. This helps them organize their work and ensure transparency in the development process.
* Developers set up GitHub integration with continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) systems such as Jenkins or Travis CI. Whenever a change is made to a repository, GitHub automatically launches CI/CD pipelines that build, test, and deploy the application. This allows them to deliver software quickly and reliably.
