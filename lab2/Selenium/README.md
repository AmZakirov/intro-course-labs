### <b>Selenium</b>

<em><b>Description:</b></em></br>
Selenium is a tool for automating testing of web applications. It is widely used in DevOps to enable continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) of applications.

<em><b>Purpose and benefits of the tool in the DevOps context:</b></em></br>
* Test Automation: Selenium allows you to create and run automated tests to test the functionality of web applications. This allows you to identify errors and problems in the early stages of development, which saves time and reduces risks.
* Cross-browser testing: Selenium supports various browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari and others. This allows you to test the application's performance in different environments and ensure that it works equally well on all platforms.
* Integration with CI/CD Tools: Selenium can be easily integrated with popular CI/CD tools such as Jenkins, GitLab CI, TeamCity and others. This allows you to run automated tests whenever code changes and provide quick feedback on the state of your application.

<em><b>Key features and functionalities:</b></em></br>
* Supports multiple programming languages: Selenium supports multiple programming languages including Java, Python, C#, Ruby and others. This allows developers to use a language with which they are familiar and in which they can work effectively.
* Supports parallel test execution
* Itâ€™s used by tech leaders, including Google, IBM, Salesforce, Cognizant, and others

<em><b>Cases and examples of how the tool is used in real-world scenarios:</b></em></br>
* With Selenium, developers can create tests that run on different operating systems and browsers. For example, they can check that a web application works correctly on both Windows and MacOS, as well as on different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
* Developers can use Selenium to automatically track errors and issues of a web application. For example, they can configure Selenium to run certain scripts regularly and check that all elements on the page are working as expected. If problems arise, Selenium can send a notification about them to developers or the DevOps team.
* Developers may face is ensuring that the application is compatible with different browser versions. Each new version of the browser may make changes to its operation and support of web standards, which may result in errors or incorrect display of web pages. Developers can use Selenium to create tests that test the functionality and display of an application on different versions of browsers.
