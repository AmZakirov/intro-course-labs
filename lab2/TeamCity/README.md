### <b>TeamCity</b>

<em><b>Description:</b></em></br>
TeamCity is a tool for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) in DevOps. It provides automation capabilities for building, testing, and deploying software, as well as managing the development process.

<em><b>Purpose and benefits of the tool in the DevOps context:</b></em></br>
* Flexibility: TeamCity allows you to configure different types of builds and deployments, including builds from source code, automated testing, artifact generation and much more. This allows DevOps teams to customize processes according to their requirements and needs.
* Integration with other tools: TeamCity easily integrates with other popular development and DevOps tools such as Git, GitHub, Jira, Docker and many more. This allows teams to use existing tools and processes in conjunction with TeamCity.
* Scalability: TeamCity supports horizontal scaling, which allows you to distribute the load across multiple build agents. This ensures high productivity and efficiency when working with large projects or teams.

<em><b>Key features and functionalities:</b></em></br>
* Continuous Integration: TeamCity automatically collects and tests source code from the repository with every change. This allows you to quickly detect and fix errors and prevent merge conflicts.
* Continuous Delivery: TeamCity allows you to automatically deploy applications to target servers or platforms after successful build and testing. This simplifies and speeds up the process of delivering software to customers.
* Build Agent Management: TeamCity allows you to manage and configure build agents to efficiently distribute tasks and resources. This allows DevOps teams to streamline the process of building and delivering software.

<em><b>Cases and examples of how the tool is used in real-world scenarios:</b></em></br>
* The development team uses TeamCity to <b>automatically build and test</b> the source code after every change. This allows you to quickly detect errors and prevent code merging problems.
* The DevOps team uses TeamCity to <b>integrate with containerization tools such as Docker</b>. With TeamCity, you can automatically create and update containers with each new build, simplifying the deployment process and ensuring consistency in your environment.\
* TeamCity provides detailed reports on the build, test and deployment process. The DevOps team can use these reports to analyze performance, identify problems, and optimize processes.
